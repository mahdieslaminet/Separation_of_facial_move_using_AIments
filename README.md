Separation of facial movements in botoxed and normal people based on electromyography signal using artificial neural network

This article explores the separation of facial movements in both normal individuals and those who have undergone Botox treatment, using electromyography (EMG) signals and artificial neural networks. The study aims to differentiate between the expressions of frown, surprise, and resting state in these two groups. Conducted on 16 women, including 6 who had received Botox, the research achieved a 91% accuracy in distinguishing all subjects and a 96% accuracy in identifying Botox-treated individuals during frown and surprise expressions. The findings can enhance the Botox injection process and improve timing to minimize side effects.


Abstract

Using electromyography (EMG), muscle behavior can be measured and analyzed. The aim of the present study is to distinguish between three states: frown, surprise, and rest. The study was conducted in two parts: the first part based on the three states in both normal and Botox-treated individuals, and the second part specifically distinguishing between the frown and surprise states in normal and Botox-treated individuals. The participants of this study were 16 women with an average age of 45Â±15, six of whom had undergone Botox treatment. EMG signal acquisition was performed using a module and Arduino. Subsequently, the signal features were extracted, and then an artificial neural network was used for data classification. The first part achieved a 91% accuracy in distinguishing all individuals, including both normal and Botox-treated, which can be useful in various applications such as robot design for recognizing and modeling facial movements. In the second part, Botox-treated individuals could be distinguished from normal individuals with 96% accuracy during frown and surprise movements. Finally, we concluded that this research could facilitate and improve the Botox injection process and also determine a more precise timing for re-injection to minimize side effects.
