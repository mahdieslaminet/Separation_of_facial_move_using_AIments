Separation of facial movements in botoxed and normal people based on electromyography signal using artificial neural network

This article explores the separation of facial movements in both normal individuals and those who have undergone Botox treatment, using electromyography (EMG) signals and artificial neural networks. The study aims to differentiate between the expressions of frown, surprise, and resting state in these two groups. Conducted on 16 women, including 6 who had received Botox, the research achieved a 91% accuracy in distinguishing all subjects and a 96% accuracy in identifying Botox-treated individuals during frown and surprise expressions. The findings can enhance the Botox injection process and improve timing to minimize side effects.
